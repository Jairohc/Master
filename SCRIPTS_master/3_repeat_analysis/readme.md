#1.-repeat-match-parser
#PARSER for repeat-match with Mummer package
##Tested with MUMmer 3.0
##Parameters:
1. Genome order
2. Minimum repeat length
3. Maximum repeat length
4. Minimum distance between repeats
5. Maximum distance between repeats
6. cut off value
###Resultados
The file of results its named **sorted results** and it has the following:

| ID | GL     | DR | RDI| TR | C   | AL    | COV |
| :-------:     | :----: | :-:| :-:| :-:| :-: | :-----:|:---:|
| nc_024789.1   |  109867| 58 | 19 | 77 |70.08| 14.28  | Pass|

GL: Genome length
DR: Direct repeats
DRI: Direct repeats inverted
TR: Total repeats 
C: Coefficient
AL: Average length
COF: Cut off value

###Genome order
This script can take as an input more than one genome exclusively in **FASTA FORMAT**, those genomes should be ordered in a list that can be build with <p>find *.fasta > genome_order</p>
we suggest to change some characters as ",,.,_,-,|,+," for values that doesn't interrupt the complete identifier, and also use complete genome names to make easier results interpretation.

###Coefficient
It is calculated from the relation between the total number of direct repeats and the genome length, it attemps to normalize genome lengths to avoid mistakes of interpretation due to rich short repeat genomes. Also it is use to divide sequences in two groups based on the **cut off value** which is defined by the user.

###R-script
This script can generate plots in three dimensions in **ps (postscript)** format, to generate this plots the user should have previously installed R-base and the library scatterplot, then the process will be authomatic. The script uses two colors that can be changed with minimal knowledgement of R-scripting, it uses the cut off value to divide the genomes in two colors.

Parameters: Minimum repeat length: 12, Maximum repeat length: 35, Minimum distance between repeats: 120, Maximum distance between repeats: 1002.
###Notes:
repeat-match has an option to do an exhaustive searches that can take a lot of of time, for this reason we use the basic option, you can add it by modifying the script adding *-E* after repeat-match line. For short genomes we have not found any differences, but we suggest to check it by yourself.

#2.-repeat-match-parser-one-by-one.sh
In order to analyze specifically one genome we made an additional script that can produce the following plots:
![Con titulo](repeat-match-one-by-one.png "An√°lisis de repetidos")
First you should have installed previously some additional libraries called **svglite** and **ggplot2**.
This script take as an input two files, first one is generated by repeat-match-parser and it is found in the folder called **repeat-finder-filtered-files** where you can take the file of the genome you want to plot, and the second is the file in fasta format of that genome.
Example:
<p>repeat-match-parser-one-by-one.sh **genome** **repeat_filtered_file_of_genome**</p>
